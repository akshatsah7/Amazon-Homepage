This project involved recreating the layout and design of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice front-end development skills by replicating a popular e-commerce website. I built the header, navigation bar, search bar, product sections, and footer, all styled to closely resemble the original Amazon homepage. This project provided hands-on experience with HTML for content structuring, CSS for styling and layout.
